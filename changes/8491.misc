After [#7934](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/7934),
[#6916](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/6916)
[#5100](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/5100) and many other we can't never
be sure about duplicated email users. Saml2 and other extensions trust in the
`User.by_email` function to get the user by email. Usually we expect that
function to return `None` or a unique user, but if there are duplicated emails,
We can expect an error.
Migration `102_ff13667243ed_create_conditinal_index_on_user` mark as unique
a combination of `email` and `state` but not takes into consideration upper
and lower case.
